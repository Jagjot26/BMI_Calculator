# BMI Calculator 
This is a simple Body Mass Index Calculator inspired by the beautiful designs made by [Ruben Vaalt](https://dribbble.com/shots/4585382-Simple-BMI-Calculator). It is a multi screen Flutter app with simple functionality but full-on custom styling. <br/>

You can choose your gender, adjust your height(in cm), select your weight(kg), and adjust the age. When you're done with all that, just tap on the calculate button to generate your BMI with some relevant text regarding your BMI.
